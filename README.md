## Introduction
`opera` aims to be a lightweight orchestrator compliant with 
[OASIS TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca).
The current compliance is with the 
[TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML v1.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3.html).
The documentation for the tool is available on [GitHub pages](https://xlab-si.github.io/xopera-docs/).
Opera implements TOSCA standard with [Ansible automation tool](https://www.ansible.com/) 
where Ansible playbooks can be used as orchestration actuators.

## Prerequisites
`opera` requires python 3 and a virtual environment. In a typical modern
Linux environment, we should already be set. In Ubuntu, however, we
might need to run the following commands:

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-wheel python-wheel-common

## Installation and Quickstart
<p align="center">

</p>

The orchestration tool is available on PyPI as a package named [`opera`](https://pypi.org/project/opera/).
Apart from the latest [production](https://pypi.org/project/opera/#history) 
version, you can also find the latest opera [develop](https://test.pypi.org/project/opera/#history) 
version (available on Test PyPI instance), which includes pre-releases so that 
you will be able to test the latest features before they are officially released.

The simplest way to test `opera` is to install it into virtual
environment:

    $ mkdir ~/opera && cd ~/opera
    $ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) $ pip install opera

To test if everything is working as expected, we can now clone xOpera's
GitHub repository and try to deploy a hello-world service:

    (.venv) $ git clone git@github.com:xlab-si/xopera-opera.git
    (.venv) $ cd xopera-opera/examples/hello
    (.venv) $ opera deploy service.yaml

If nothing went wrong, new empty file has been created at
`/tmp/playing-opera/hello/hello.txt`.

To delete the created directory, we can undeploy our stuff by running:

    (.venv) $ opera undeploy

And that is it.

## Common examples
This part focuses on different common ways of usage for opera orchestration tool. 

### OpenStack client setup
Because using OpenStack modules from Ansible playbooks is quite common,
we can install `opera` with all required OpenStack libraries by running:

    (.venv) $ pip install -U opera[openstack]

Before we can actually use the OpenStack functionality, we also need to
obtain the OpenStack credentials. If we log into OpenStack and navigate
to the `Access & Security` -\> `API Access` page, we can download the rc
file with all required information.

At the start of each session (e.g., when we open a new command line
console), we must source the rc file by running:

    (venv) $ . openstack.rc

After we enter the password, we are ready to start using the OpenStack
modules in playbooks that implement life cycle operations.

## Other resources and services
The table below show other important resources that are connected to `opera`.
