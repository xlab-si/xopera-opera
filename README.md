## Introduction
`opera` aims to be a lightweight orchestrator compliant with [OASIS TOSCA]. 
The current compliance is with the [OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML v1.3]. 
The [xOpera documentation] is available on GitHub pages. 
`opera` implements the TOSCA standard with [Ansible] automation tool where Ansible playbooks can be used as 
orchestration actuators within the TOSCA interface operations.

## Prerequisites
`opera` requires Python 3 and a virtual environment. 
In a typical modern Linux environment, we should already be set. 
In Ubuntu, however, we might need to run the following commands:

```console
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-wheel python-wheel-common
```

## Installation and Quickstart
The orchestration tool is available on PyPI as a package named [opera]. 
Apart from the latest [PyPI production] version, you can also find the latest opera [PyPI development] version, which 
includes pre-releases so that you will be able to test the latest features before they are officially released.

The simplest way to test `opera` is to install it into Python virtual environment:

```console
$ mkdir ~/opera && cd ~/opera
$ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip install opera
```

To test if everything is working as expected, we can now clone xOpera's
GitHub repository and try to deploy a hello-world service:

```console
(.venv) $ git clone git@github.com:xlab-si/xopera-opera.git
(.venv) $ cd xopera-opera/examples/hello
(.venv) $ opera deploy service.yaml
[Worker_0]   Deploying my-workstation_0
[Worker_0]   Deployment of my-workstation_0 complete
[Worker_0]   Deploying hello_0
[Worker_0]     Executing create on hello_0
[Worker_0]   Deployment of hello_0 complete
```

If nothing went wrong, new empty file has been created at `/tmp/playing-opera/hello/hello.txt`.

To delete the created directory, we can undeploy our stuff by running:

```console
(.venv) $ opera undeploy
[Worker_0]   Undeploying hello_0
[Worker_0]     Executing delete on hello_0
[Worker_0]   Undeployment of hello_0 complete
[Worker_0]   Undeploying my-workstation_0
[Worker_0]   Undeployment of my-workstation_0 complete
```

And that is it. 
For more startup examples please visit [examples folder], or go to [xopera-examples] repository if you wish to explore 
deeper with more complex xOpera examples. 
If you want to use just xOpera TOSCA parser go to [xopera-tosca-parser] repository. 
If you want to use opera commands from an API take a look at [xopera-api] repository. 
You can also take a look at the [xOpera SaaS] component, which is designed for business partners and enterprise users.
