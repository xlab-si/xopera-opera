node_types:
  tosca.nodes.Root:
    description: >
      This is the default (root) TOSCA Node Type that all other TOSCA nodes
      should extend. This allows all TOSCA nodes to have a consistent set of
      features for modeling and management (e.g, consistent definitions for
      requirements, capabilities, and lifecycle interfaces).
    attributes:
      tosca_id:
        type: string
        description: >
          A unique identifier of the realized instance of a Node Template that
          derives from any TOSCA normative type.
      tosca_name:
        type: string
        description: >
          This attribute reflects the name of the Node Template as defined in
          the TOSCA service template. This name is not unique to the realized
          instance model of corresponding deployed application as each
          template in the model can result in one or more instances (e.g.,
          scaled) when orchestrated to a provider environment.
      state:
        type: string
        description: >
          The state of the node instance. See section "Node States" for
          allowed values.

  tosca.nodes.Compute:
    derived_from: tosca.nodes.Root
    description: >
      The TOSCA Compute node represents one or more real or virtual processors
      of software applications or services along with other essential local
      resources. Collectively, the resources the compute node represents can
      logically be viewed as a (real or virtual) “server”.

      that can be managed and run by a TOSCA Compute Node Type.
