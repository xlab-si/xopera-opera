Orchestrator xOpera is a tool that follows OASIS TOSCA standard and unlocks its benefits of providing multi-cloud
orchestration support. According to this business value of this tool can be seen through different perspectives. Firstly,
the aim is to have an orchestration tool which is easy to install and easy to use. Installation process is very simple
and requires only python and possibly a virtual environment. Opera package is visible on PyPI so even older versions
can be installed. Secondly, opera is a very dynamic tool which can be used for simple or complex orchestration of
applications because one can prepare his own TOSCA templates that are unique and based on his use case. All
of the templates can also be modified and reused with xOpera. And lastly, as opera is evolving, there are many different
CLI commands that can be used with it. Besides deploying and undeploying a solution, opera can be used for TOSCA CSAR
service template validation or for printing out outputs of the orchestration.
