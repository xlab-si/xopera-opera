xOpera SaaS
***********

The Software as a Service edition of xOpera is available at `xopera-radon.xlab.si`_.

It is a multi-user service offering all capabilities of the console-based ``opera``, providing all of its
functionalities as a service of Web 3.0 where you can interact with it through the browser, or an API, if you so desire.

Please read the `warnings <xopera_saas_warnings_>`_ at the bottom, as you accept some inherent risks when using xOpera
SaaS.

=================
Browser interface
=================

Using the browser version is straightforward.
Let's go through the basic workflow, where you:

1. Have secrets you need to define prior to deployment.

2. Author a new workspace to contain your project.

3. Register your secrets to be available in the workspace.

4. Use the browser to create a new xOpera project from a CSAR.

5. Have to specify which service template and inputs you are using, then validate them.

6. In the end, deploy the project.

    The secrets screen.

The first thing we need to do is create whatever secrets are necessary for your deployment to run.
For example, these are your cloud provider secrets, SSH public keys, among others.
The way they are provided is through files - with each secret, you declare a file (and contents) that will be
present in your project when you create it.

Next, let's create a workspace to contain our projects.

.. _xopera_saas_workspaces:

.. figure:: /images/xopera-saas-workspaces.png
    :target: _images/xopera-saas-workspaces.png
    :width: 95%
    :align: center

    Manage numerous workspaces directly from your browser.

Creating one is simple, you just need to choose a name.
You are assigned owner privileges automatically, and you can share this workspace with other users, who can then
also create projects in it.
In :numref:`xopera_saas_workspaces`, the `DemoWorkspace` projects is shared with us, which we can determine by looking
at the *Ownership* column.

Sharing workspaces is done through the dropdown menu on the right, by clicking on the kebab icon.
Sharing individual projects is not possible.
To share a workspace with another user, use the email they used to sign in to xOpera SaaS.
The user must have previously logged in to xOpera SaaS at least once.

The next thing we need to do is to assign the secrets we created in the previous step to this workspace.
This is the only way they are applied to projects within this workspace.
As with sharing workspaces, this is done through the dropdown on the right of each workspace's row.
When you apply a secret, this is reflected in the list of workspaces.

All that is left is to create and deploy a project.
To do this, click the :guilabel:`Add Project` button, choose a name and select your CSAR file.

.. _xopera_saas_project:

.. figure:: /images/xopera-saas-project.png
    :target: _images/xopera-saas-project.png
    :width: 95%
    :align: center

    The main xOpera SaaS project management screen.

To deploy the project, open the management window, input your service template filename and upload your inputs file
using the :guilabel:`Browse` button.
You can :guilabel:`Run validation` on the service template and inputs prior to deploying as a basic sanity check.

Each invocation (deployment, undeployment) has an entry in the list of invocations.
The status and outputs are reported and updated to allow you to see the progress.
In case of errors, you can:

* Run validations.
* Inspect the inputs, `stdout` and `stderr`.
* Download a debug package.

The last option is the way to go if the deployment fails in an unexpected way.
You will be served with an archive file containing the exact project structure xOpera SaaS uses for deployment,
so you can attempt to reproduce (and hopefully, fix) the error locally.

To undeploy or delete the project, press the corresponding button.

The API

A preview of the API reference is presented in :numref:`xopera_saas_api_excerpt` and the whole reference is located at
the `SaaS API page`_.

    An excerpt of the xOpera SaaS API.

The following code block shows a complete example of using the xOpera SaaS API through ``curl``::

    csar_base64="$(base64 --wrap 0 test.csar)"
    api="https://xopera-radon.xlab.si/api"
    auth_base_url="https://openid-radon.xlab.si"
    secret_base64="$(echo 'hello!' | base64 -)"

    your_username=YOUR_USERNAME
    your_password=YOUR_PASSWORD

    alias cookiecurl="curl -sSL --cookie-jar cookiejar.txt --cookie cookiejar.txt"
    response_from_credentials_redirected_to_next_auth="$(cookiecurl $api/secret)"

    response_radonauth="$(cookiecurl ${auth_base_url}${redirect_url_to_radonauth})"

    login_url_radonauth="$(echo $response_radonauth | xmllint --html --xpath "string(//form[@id='kc-form-login']/@action)" - 2>/dev/null)"
    cookiecurl "$login_url_radonauth" -d "username=$your_username" -d "password=$your_password" -d credentialId=""
    redirect_url="$redirect_url_radonauth"
    ### end RADON auth login flow ###

    ### login flow - internal auth ###
    redirect_url_internal="$(echo $response_from_credentials_redirected_to_next_auth | xmllint --html --xpath "string(//form[@id='kc-form-login']/@action)" - 2>/dev/null)"
    redirect_url="$redirect_url_internal"
    ### end internal auth login flow ###

    # final login step, sets cookies and automatically completes the /secret request
    cookiecurl "$redirect_url" -d "username=$your_username" -d "password=$your_password" -d credentialId=""

    # normal usage

.. _xopera_saas_warnings:

================================================
Warnings about your secrets and general security
================================================

Your secrets - not for xOpera SaaS, but those you add for services you access in CSARs etc - are stored in
plaintext on the server xOpera SaaS is running on, and retrieved on request.
This is necessary for the execution of your orchestration actions.

You need to use caution with the secrets you submit and with whom you share your workspaces.

Users you share workspaces with do not get direct access to secrets.
All projects created under the workspace have access to them, and, as users have control of the filesystem,
they can also access the secrets by deploying a CSAR.

If you request xOpera SaaS server administrators to help you or access your project, they will also be in a position
to access the secrets.
Whenever possible, use temporary secrets with limited access to the smallest required set of capabilities
to improve your security.
